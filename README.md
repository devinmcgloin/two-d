# two-d
Two Dimensional Geometry in Python

## Why
This Library exists to solve 2d geometry problems.

It exports ways to represent points, line segments, angles and polygons.

As well as solving for common problems in 2d geometry.

## Algorithms 
* Convex Hull
* Line Segment Intersection
* Delaunay Triangulation
* Voronoi
* Closest Pair of Points
* Largest Empty Circle
* Polygon Triangulation
